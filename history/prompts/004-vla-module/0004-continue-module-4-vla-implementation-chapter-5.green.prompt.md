## Response snapshot

Continued implementation of Module 4 VLA Chapter 5 Capstone from Phase 7-8 of tasks.md. Created comprehensive capstone chapter integrating all VLA components:

**Core Concepts Implemented**:
1. Complete System Architecture - Layered architecture with perception, cognition, and action layers
2. Safety-Critical Design - 4-layer safety hierarchy (E-stop → boundary → trajectory → nominal)
3. Complete VLA System Implementation - Full VLASystem class with state machine
4. Evaluation Metrics - Comprehensive testing framework with WER, grounding accuracy, task completion

**Key Artifacts Created**:
- chapter-5-capstone.md (1332 lines) - Complete capstone chapter with 8 self-assessment questions
- capstone-architecture.md - Mermaid diagrams for system architecture, data flow, safety layers
- complete_vla_system.py - Production-ready VLA system with 600+ lines

**Module 4 Completion Status**:
- All 5 chapters complete (1: VLA Foundations, 2: Voice-to-Action, 3: LLM Planning, 4: Multimodal Fusion, 5: Capstone)
- 12 diagrams created across all chapters
- 5 code examples with production-quality implementations
- 8-phase implementation plan fully executed

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Module 4 VLA implementation completed - all 70 tasks from tasks.md executed
- 🧪 Tests: Content completeness PASS, cross-reference validation PASS, file structure PASS
- 📁 Files: 3 files created (chapter-5-capstone.md, capstone-architecture.md, complete_vla_system.py)
- 🔁 Next: Module 4 ready for review/merge to main branch
- 🧠 Reflection: Continuation session successfully completed remaining implementation tasks; PHR system enabled seamless context recovery

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - continuation from context worked correctly
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Content check PASS, structure validation PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Continuation from previous context (context window exhausted)
- Next experiment: Test PHR-based context recovery with longer gap between sessions
