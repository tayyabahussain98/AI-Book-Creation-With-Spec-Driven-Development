# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | ✅ Pass | All sections focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW |
| Requirement Completeness | ✅ Pass | 30 functional requirements defined, all testable |
| Feature Readiness | ✅ Pass | 5 user stories with acceptance scenarios |

## Specification Metrics

- **User Stories**: 5 (P1: 2, P2: 2, P3: 1)
- **Functional Requirements**: 30 total
- **Edge Cases**: 6 identified
- **Success Criteria**: 12 (8 measurable + 4 qualitative)
- **Key Entities**: 8 defined
- **Dependencies**: 5 listed
- **Assumptions**: 6 documented
- **Out of Scope Items**: 7 explicitly excluded

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`
- All content follows the simulation-first approach consistent with Modules 1-3
- No clarification markers present - spec is ready for implementation planning
