# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Details**:
- All 16 checklist items pass validation
- Specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic
- User stories are properly prioritized (P1-P5) and independently testable
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-014) are clear and measurable
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are technology-agnostic and measurable
- Edge cases identified and addressed
- Assumptions, dependencies, and out-of-scope items clearly documented
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

**Ready for**: `/sp.plan` (planning phase)

## Notes

- Specification adheres to constitution principles (Spec-Driven Development, Source-Grounded Accuracy)
- Educational content focus aligns with book's teaching goals
- ROS 2 Humble/Iron versions explicitly specified per constitution (Verifiable and Runnable Code)
- Success criteria focus on learning outcomes rather than implementation metrics
